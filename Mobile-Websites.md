# Mobile Websites
A list of useful mobile websites that work better than most apps.

## Weather & Time

- [NWS Text Forecast](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=34.7462&lon=-92.2768&unit=0&lg=english&FcstType=text&TextType=1) - Detailed & accurate. Getting your text forecast link takes a bit of work. Start at forecast.weather.gov, then get your local forecast using city or zip. Scroll to the bottom and you'll see "Text Only Forecast". Click and bookmark
- [TimeandDate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/new-york) - Great way to check time, time zones, weather, & holidays. [Time.gov](https://Time.gov) gets an honorable mention as it's official US time. But the layout on mobile isn't ideal.

## News

- [CNN Lite](https://lite.cnn.com/) - Text only news site. There are a few more listed [here](https://greycoder.com/a-list-of-text-only-new-sites/), but this one is the best IMHO.
- [ReadSpike](https://readspike.com/world/) - Fantastic and simple news aggregator
- [Skimfeed](https://skimfeed.com/news.html#) is an alternative but nearly as well laid out
- [Techmeme](https://www.techmeme.com/m/) - The tech news site that is worth a daily check.

## Utilities

- [Random.org Password Gen](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=5&len=19&format=html&rnd=new) - Again I religiously use a Password Manager but there are instances I just need quick password created. Also faster than most apps
- [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com) - It has a ton of uses but I keep this bookmarked to send something securely to an email address or a computer.

## Christian Resources

- [Bible Web App](https://biblewebapp.com/study/) - While I have other Bible Apps this page loads faster and makes copy/paste & search a breeze.
- [MyUtmost](https://utmost.org/) - The classic daily devotional by Oswald Chambers. Faster and easier than the app. [OurDailyBread](https://ourdailybread.ca/daily-bread-devotional/) is another.

## Bonus Tips
1. Get URL from iPhone to your computer fast?  Use [is.gd](https://is.gd). I use this weekly it seems. Take the URL and shorten it, then type the short URL into the desktop.
2. Get URL or text from computer to mobile fast? Use a QR code. Since I use DuckDuckGo as my search engine I use the !QR with the url or text to quickly create a QR code that I scan with my iPhone.
3. You can make most any site text only with [Textise.net](https://www.textise.net). Great way to simplify a website and then bookmark.
